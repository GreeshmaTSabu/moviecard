			{name: "Yathra",rating: 8.2,review :"Yatra is not a film about just one man. It is about what that one-man meant to millions of people.Director-writer Mahi V Raghav told me that political biopics has never clicked at the box office in India. He did not just understand the risk of taking up such a project, he was also mindful not to repeat the common mistakes of the biopic genre. The hack is not to burden the script with too much information. For example, NTR: Kathanayakudu was crammed with way too many details that weighed down the entire film. The filmmakers had included at least three different moments just to illustrate one point: NTR was always punctual. He was neither late nor early. He was always on time. A passing reference would have served the purpose, instead of dedicating the precious screentime to play up this trivia, which has no value to add to the narration.But, for Raghav, facts are not as important as narrative. He has avoided writing trivial details into the script, by focusing on just one part of YSR’s life, where he revived the fortunes of a political party that was staring at a definite electoral loss.",image: "images/melle.jpg"},

			{name: "June",rating: 8,review :"June opens with a familiar image: a young woman, June (Rajisha Vijayan), takes a solo trip to supposedly give her life a fresh start. It’s easy to guess what prompted her to take this journey, and soon enough, episodic flashbacks transport us to her high school days. The entire film, in fact, feels familiar, but the fresh treatment saves it from being another cliched nostalgia trip. Friendship, romance, heartbreak, reunions, and weddings. This is what June is all about. It introduces us to a group of fun characters who bear resemblances to your former classmates — you feel like hanging out with them. There is June’s first crush and boyfriend Noel (Sarjano Khalid) — a slightly introverted kid yearning to be a filmmaker — and then there is Anand (Arjun Ashokan), a stalker from a different school. After they enter adulthood, things turn a bit complicated because Noel’s constant need to please his father irks the independent June.Anand goes through an interesting transformation in the second half, which brings a much-needed lightheartedness to the proceedings. After the recent Varathan, Arjun once again impresses with a vibrant performance. I also developed a particular fondness for the ‘Asura’ trio played by Sanju KS, Akhil Manoj, and Harisankar.",image: "images/june.jpg"},
